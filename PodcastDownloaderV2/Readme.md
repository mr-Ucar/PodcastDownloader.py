# Audio Podcast Downloader

### The aim of this simple project is to help and motivate my students who tries to learn English and also how to code in Python.

This script is the version 2. The first Podcast Downloader in this repo has a simpler code. This one is a bit more complex one, but still simple and serve the purpose.
